            Base class for all "Actions". An Action is an object, that receives various MouseInput events
            once it has been "Set" by a call to <see cref="M:CADability.IFrame.SetAction(CADability.Actions.Action)"/>. After performing the 
            required tasks, the Action is removed from the ActionStack and the previous active action
            is resumed. The action on the bottom of the action stack is the <see cref="T:CADability.Actions.SelectObjectsAction"/>.
            Use the <see cref="T:CADability.Actions.ConstructAction"/> for typical drawing purposes, because it provides a convenient
            set of methods. If an action object is set by a call to <see cref="M:CADability.IFrame.SetAction(CADability.Actions.Action)"/> the following
            sequence of calls to the new and the old action is executed:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><description>new action: <see cref="M:CADability.Actions.Action.OnSetAction"/> (as a reaction to <see cref="M:CADability.IFrame.SetAction(CADability.Actions.Action)"/>)</description></item>
            <item><description>old action: <see cref="M:CADability.Actions.Action.OnInactivate(CADability.Actions.Action,System.Boolean)"/> (may call <see cref="M:CADability.IFrame.RemoveActiveAction"/> if desired)</description></item>
            <item><description>new action: <see cref="M:CADability.Actions.Action.OnActivate(CADability.Actions.Action,System.Boolean)"/> (from now on the new action may receive mouse events).</description></item>
            <item><description>After the new action calls <see cref="M:CADability.Actions.Action.RemoveThisAction"/> or someone calls <see cref="M:CADability.IFrame.RemoveActiveAction"/>
            the new action will receive <see cref="M:CADability.Actions.Action.OnInactivate(CADability.Actions.Action,System.Boolean)"/>. </description></item>
            <item><description>The old action (if still on the stack)
            will receive a call to <see cref="M:CADability.Actions.Action.OnActivate(CADability.Actions.Action,System.Boolean)"/> and finally </description></item>

            Approximate this curve and return the approximation. maxError specifies the maximal
            allowed error, i.e. the maximal deviation of the returned curve from this curve.
            Is linesOnly ist true, only lines are returned, if linesOnly is false, lines
            and circular arcs are returned. The result is usually a path consiting of lines and 
            arcs or lines only.

            Interne Klasse für den HitTest für verlängerte Pfade oder PolyLines.
            Wird lediglich für das Suchen im QuadTree verwendet, muss deshalb nicht
            so genau sein. Insbesondere werden von der ersten und letzten Kurve die
            Verlängerunden verwendet, was nicht exakt ist, denn man müsste nur die
            Verlängerung in eine Richtung verwenden. Sollte aber keine Probleme machen.
            Wird nur für offene PolyLinien bzw. Pfade verwendet.

            This class filters <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.IGeoObject"/>s according to their attributes or other properties.
            A <see cref="T:CADability.Project"/> contains a <see cref="T:CADability.Attribute.FilterList"/> which contains Filters. The task of a filter
            is to decide, whether a IGeoObject is accepted by this filter or not. The <see cref="T:CADability.Attribute.FilterList"/> is
            used by the <see cref="!:SelectObjectsAction"/> to decide, whether an object may be selected or not.
            Filters may also be used for other purposes. In this standard implementation the attributes of a IGeoObject
            and the type of the object are used to accept or reject an object. 
            You may derive a class from this Filter class and handle the static <see cref="F:CADability.Attribute.Filter.Constructor"/> delegate
            by constructing your own filter. In your derived class you can use any criteria of a IGeoObject
            for filtering, e.g. the contents of <see cref="P:CADability.GeoObject.IGeoObject.UserData"/>.

            sind auch nicht sparsamer, im Gegenteil. Und es darf immer nur eine Liste geben,
            denn sonst ist auch z.B. die ColorList nicht dingfest zu machen.

            If A is symmetric, then A = V*D*V' where the eigenvalue matrix D is
            diagonal and the eigenvector matrix V is orthogonal.
            I.e. A = V.Multiply(D.Multiply(V.Transpose())) and 
            V.Multiply(V.Transpose()) equals the identity matrix.
            If A is not symmetric, then the eigenvalue matrix D is block diagonal
            with the real eigenvalues in 1-by-1 blocks and any complex eigenvalues,
            lambda + i*mu, in 2-by-2 blocks, [lambda, mu; -mu, lambda].  The
            columns of V represent the eigenvectors in the sense that A*V = V*D,
            i.e. A.Multiply(V) equals V.Multiply(D).  The matrix V may be badly
            conditioned, or even singular, so the validity of the equation
            A = V*D*Inverse(V) depends upon V.cond().

            <remarks>
            For an m-by-n matrix A with m >= n, the LU decomposition is an m-by-n
            unit lower triangular matrix L, an n-by-n upper triangular matrix U,
            and a permutation vector piv of length m so that A(piv,:) = L*U.
            <c> If m &lt; n, then L is m-by-m and U is m-by-n. </c>
            The LU decompostion with pivoting always exists, even if the matrix is
            singular, so the constructor will never fail.  The primary use of the
            LU decomposition is in the solution of square systems of simultaneous
            linear equations.  This will fail if IsNonSingular() returns false.

            For an m-by-n matrix A with m >= n, the QR decomposition is an m-by-n
            orthogonal matrix Q and an n-by-n upper triangular matrix R so that
            A = Q*R.<br/>
            
            The QR decompostion always exists, even if the matrix does not have
            full rank, so the constructor will never fail.  The primary use of the
            QR decomposition is in the least squares solution of nonsquare systems
            of simultaneous linear equations.  This will fail if <c>IsFullRank()</c>

            die Oberfläche zwar exakt mit NURBS annähern, aber die Kurven sind i.a. nicht mehr linear auf

            A <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.IGeoObject">GeoObject</see> which always appears in the same size in a view. It is not scaled when the view is zoomed.
            These objects can not be kept in displaylists and hence have a poor performance when used in high numbers.
            The objects rotate with the view when viewed from different directions. 
            The <see cref="P:CADability.GeoObject.UnscaledGeoObject.Location"/> specifies the position of the origin (GeoPoint(0,0,0)) of the referenced GeoObject.
            Usually you would center the referenced object at the origin so this object will be centered at the <see cref="P:CADability.GeoObject.UnscaledGeoObject.Location"/>.
            In contrast to the <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.Icon"/> object, which always shows its face to the viewer and is much faster, 
            because it can be kept in the display list.
            Since this object does not have a well defined size in world coordinates, it is only pickable or selectable
            at its insertion point. The size of the object is assumed in device units (pixels)
            The Layer of this object will be taken into account for the objects visibility, not the layer of the 
            referenced object.
            <remarks>The use of this object is not recommended because it has a poor performance in both display and selection.
            Consider using <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.Icon"/> instead.</remarks>

            Edge is a abstract description of an egde on a <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.Face"/>. An Edge may belong to one or two faces.
            Edges don't exist without faces (use <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.IGeoObject"/> and <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.ICurve"/>derived classes for
            simple 3d curves). The Edge is defined in several ways, which are overdetermined and therfore must always
            be in a consistent state: It is the pur 3-dimensional curve, an <see cref="T:CADability.GeoObject.ICurve"/>, and on each Face
            the edge is defined as a 2-dimensional curve on the surface (see <see cref="P:CADability.GeoObject.Face.Surface"/>), which has 
            a 2-dimensional (u/v) coordinate system (parametric space).
            The Edge may be an outer or an inner edge on each face or some curve on the inside of a face (typically an
            outlining curve for a certain <see cref="T:CADability.Projection"/>). The edge may not be outside of a face.

                    <b>LoadLibrary</b> can be used to map a DLL module and return a handle that
                    can be used in <see cref="M:CADability.Kernel.GetProcAddress(System.IntPtr,System.String)" /> to get the address of a DLL
                    function.  <b>LoadLibrary</b> can also be used to map other executable
                    modules.  For example, the function can specify an .exe file to get a
                    handle that can be used in <b>FindResource</b> or <b>LoadResource</b>.
                    However, do not use <b>LoadLibrary</b> to run an .exe file, use the

                    The working set of a process is the set of memory pages currently visible to
                    the process in physical RAM memory.  These pages are resident and available
                    for an application to use without triggering a page fault.  The minimum and
                    maximum working set sizes affect the virtual memory paging behavior of a

                    The operating system allocates working set sizes on a first-come,
                    first-served basis.  For example, if an application successfully sets 40
                    megabytes as its minimum working set size on a 64-megabyte system, and a
                    second application requests a 40-megabyte working set size, the operating
                    system denies the second application's request.

                    Using the <b>SetProcessWorkingSetSize</b> function to set an application's
                    minimum and maximum working set sizes does not guarantee that the requested
                    memory will be reserved, or that it will remain resident at all times.  When
                    the application is idle, or a low-memory situation causes a demand for memory,
                    the operating system can reduce the application's working set.  An application
                    can use the <b>VirtualLock</b> function to lock ranges of the application's
                    virtual address space in memory; however, that can potentially degrade the
                    performance of the system.
                </para>
                <para>
                    When you increase the working set size of an application, you are taking away
                    physical memory from the rest of the system.  This can degrade the performance
                    of other applications and the system as a whole.  It can also lead to failures
                    of operations that require physical memory to be present; for example,
                    creating processes, threads, and kernel pool.  Thus, you must use the
                    <b>SetProcessWorkingSetSize</b> function carefully.  You must always consider
                    the performance of the whole system when you are designing an application.

            				<b>cBluebits</b>, and <b>cBlueShift</b> members. The palette should be created and realized in

            			<description>
            				Defined in the pixel format descriptors of hardware that supports one hardware palette in
            				256-color mode only. For such systems to use hardware acceleration, the hardware palette must be in
            				a fixed order (for example, 3-3-2) when in RGBA mode or must match the logical palette when in
            				color-index mode.
            				
            				When this flag is set, you must call SetSystemPaletteUse in your program to force a one-to-one
            				mapping of the logical palette and the system palette. If your OpenGL hardware supports multiple
            				hardware palettes and the device driver can allocate spare hardware palettes for OpenGL, this

            so muss der Bereich neu gezeichnet werden. Compose löst den RepaintXxxEvent
            (z.B. RepaintDrawingEvent) aus. Die Handler dieses Events (gewöhnlich 
            nur einer) bekommen ein PaintToGDI Objekt, mit dessen Hilfe sie zeichnen
            können.

            This class is used to give acces and store information that influences global behaviour of the
            CADability system.
            There is a static variable <see cref="F:CADability.Settings.GlobalSettings"/>. This is the only use of settings in CADability.
            This class behaves as a hierarchical dictionary. The keys are strings, which may have the form "mainkey.subkey"
            The values are objects, i.e. any kind of data.
            If the objects implement the IShowProperty interface they are displayed in the global setting tab of the controlcenter.
            There are some classes like <see cref="T:CADability.ColorSetting"/>, <see cref="!:IntergerProperty"/>, <see cref="T:CADability.UserInterface.DoubleProperty"/>,
            <see cref="T:CADability.UserInterface.StringProperty"/> which can be used as a setting value. If you instead simply use a double or string value
            the setting will be only available to programming code but not to the user in the ControlCenter.

            Given a generic IList&lt;T&gt; interface, wrap a non-generic (untyped)
            IList interface around it. The non-generic interface will contain the same objects as the 
            underlying generic list, but can be used in places that require a non-generic interface.
            This method is useful when interfacing generic interfaces with older code that uses non-generic interfaces.
            </summary>
            <remarks>Many generic collections already implement the non-generic interfaces directly. This
            method will first attempt to simply cast <paramref name="typedList"/> to IList. If that
            succeeds, it is returned; if it fails, then a wrapper object is created.</remarks>

            and Y times in the other set, the symmetric difference contains the item AbsoluteValue(X - Y) times. 
            The source collections are not changed.
            A new collection is created with the symmetric difference of the collections; the order of the
            items in this collection is undefined.

             <summary>
             Bag&lt;T&gt; is a collection that contains items of type T. 
             Unlike a Set, duplicate items (items that compare equal to each other) are allowed in an Bag. 
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             <p>The items are compared in one of two ways. If T implements IComparable&lt;T&gt; 
             then the Equals method of that interface will be used to compare items, otherwise the Equals
             method from Object will be used. Alternatively, an instance of IComparer&lt;T&gt; can be passed
             to the constructor to use to compare items.</p>
             <p>Bag is implemented as a hash table. Inserting, deleting, and looking up an
             an element all are done in approximately constant time, regardless of the number of items in the bag.</p>
             <p>When multiple equal items are stored in the bag, they are stored as a representative item and a count. 
             If equal items can be distinguished, this may be noticable. For example, if a case-insensitive
             comparer is used with a Bag&lt;string&gt;, and both "hello", and "HELLO" are added to the bag, then the
             bag will appear to contain two copies of "hello" (the representative item).</p>
             <p><see cref="!:OrderedBag&lt;T&gt;"/> is similar, but uses comparison instead of hashing, maintain
             the items in sorted order, and stores distinct copies of items that compare equal.</p>

            <p>The <c>MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra</c> provides the fundamental operations 
            of numerical linear algebra.  Various constructors create Matrices from two 
            dimensional arrays of double precision floating point numbers.  Various "gets" 
            and "sets" provide access to submatrices and matrix elements.  Several methods 
            implement basic matrix arithmetic, including matrix addition and
            multiplication, matrix norms, and element-by-element array operations.
            Methods for reading and printing matrices are also included.  All the
            operations in this version of the Matrix Class involve real matrices.
            Complex matrices may be handled in a future version.</p>
            
            <p>Five fundamental matrix decompositions, which consist of pairs or triples
            of matrices, permutation vectors, and the like, produce results in five
            decomposition classes.  These decompositions are accessed by the Matrix
            class to compute solutions of simultaneous linear equations, determinants,
            inverses and other matrix functions.</p>
            
            The five decompositions are:<br/>
            <UL>
            <LI>Cholesky Decomposition of symmetric, positive definite matrices.</LI>
            <LI>LU Decomposition of rectangular matrices.</LI>
            <LI>QR Decomposition of rectangular matrices.</LI>
            <LI>Singular Value Decomposition of rectangular matrices.</LI>
            <LI>Eigenvalue Decomposition of both symmetric and nonsymmetric square matrices.</LI>
            </UL>
            
            <p><b>Example of use:</b> Solve a linear system <c>A x = b</c> and compute the residual norm, 
            <c>||b - A x||</c>.</p>
            <code>
            double[,] vals = {{1.,2.,3.},{4.,5.,6.},{7.,8.,10.}};
            Matrix a = new Matrix(vals);
            Matrix b = Matrix.Random(3,1);
            Matrix x = a.Solve(b);
            Matrix r = a * x - b;

            By default this value is set to false, no dimension blocks will be generated when adding dimension entities to the document.
            It will be the responsibility of the program importing the DXF to generate the drawing that represent the dimensions.<br />
            When set to true the block that represents the dimension will be generated,
            keep in mind that this process is limited and not all options available in the dimension style will be reflected in the final result.<br />
            When importing a file if the dimension block is present it will be read, regardless of this value.
            If, later, the dimension is modified all updates will be done with the limited dimension drawing capabilities of the library,
            in this case, if you want that the new modifications to be reflected when the file is saved again you can set the dimension block to null,
            and the program reading the resulting file will regenerate the block with the new modifications.

            Set this value to null to force the program that reads the resulting DXF file to generate the dimension drawing block,
            some programs do not even care about this block and will always generate their own dimension drawings.<br />
            You can even use your own dimension drawing setting this value with the resulting block.
            The assigned block name is irrelevant, it will be automatically modified to accommodate the naming conventions of the blocks for dimension (*D#).<br />
            The block will be overwritten when adding the dimension to a <see cref="T:netDxf.DxfDocument">DxfDocument</see> if <c>BuildDimensionBlocks</c> is set to true.

            The entities that make a loop can be any combination of lines, light weight polylines, polylines, circles, arcs, ellipses, and splines.<br />
            The entities that define a loop should define a closed path, they have to be on the same plane as the hatch, and with the same normal;
            if these conditions are not met the result might be unpredictable. <br />
            Entities expressed in 3d coordinates like lines, polylines, and splines will be projected into its local plane.
            All edges that make a HatchBoundaryPath are 2d objects, only have X and Y coordinates.
            This is why to avoid unexpected results is important that all entities that define the paths have the same normal, same reference plane.

            Changes to the insert, the block, or the document insertion units will require this method to be called manually.<br />
            The attributes position, normal, rotation, text height, width factor, and oblique angle values includes the transformations applied to the insertion,
            if required this method will calculate the proper values according to the ones defined by the attribute definition.<br />
            All the attribute values can be changed manually independently to its definition,
            but, usually, you will want them to be transformed with the insert based on the local values defined by the attribute definition.<br />
            This method only applies to attributes that have a definition, some DXF files might generate attributes that have no definition in the block.<br />
            At the moment the attribute width factor and oblique angle are not calculated, this is applied to inserts with non uniform scaling.

            The way the vertex indexes for a polyface mesh are defined follows the DXF documentation.
            The values of the vertex indexes specify one of the previously defined vertexes by the index in the list plus one.
            If the index is negative, the edge that begins with that vertex is invisible.
            For example if the vertex index in the list is 0 the vertex index for the face will be 1, and
            if the edge between the vertexes 0 and 1 is hidden the vertex index for the face will be -1.<br/>
            The maximum number of vertexes per face is 4.

            The shape size is relative to the actual size of the shape definition.
            The size value works as an scale value applied to the dimensions of the shape definition.
            The DXF allows for negative values but that is the same as rotating the shape 180 degrees.<br />
            Size values must be greater than zero. Default: 1.0.

            Any of the vector scale components cannot be zero.<br />
            Even thought the DXF has a code for the Z scale it seems that it has no use.
            The X and Y components multiplied by the original size of the PDF page represent the width and height of the final underlay.
            The Z component even thought it is present in the DXF it seems it has no use.

            AutoCad does not allow the creation of viewports from open shapes such as LwPolylines, Polylines, or ellipse arcs;
            but if they are edited afterward, making them open, it will not complain, and they will work without problems.
            So, it is possible to use open shapes as clipping boundaries, even if it is not recommended.
            It might not be supported by all programs that read DXF files and a redraw of the layout might be required to show them correctly inside AutoCad.<br />
            Only X and Y coordinates will be used the entity normal will be considered as UnitZ.<br />
            When the viewport is added to the document this entity will be added too.

            <remarks>
            For testing purposes a point is considered inside a segment,
            if it falls inside the area from start to end of the segment that extends infinitely perpendicularly to its direction.
            Later, if needed, you can use the PointLineDistance method, if the distance is zero the point is along the line defined by the start and end points.

            This is what one AutoCAD unit is equal to for the purpose of inserting and scaling images with an associated resolution.
            It is recommended to use the same units as the header variable InsUnits, or just use none to avoid any unwanted scaling when inserting images into the drawing.

            An extended data control string can be either "{"or "}".
            These braces enable applications to organize their data by subdividing the data into lists.
            The left brace begins a list, and the right brace terminates the most recent list. Lists can be nested.
